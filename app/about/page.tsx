        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">About Me</h1>

        <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">
          I am an AI/ML Engineer focused on building real-world GenAI and agentic systems that solve practical business problems. My work sits at the intersection of AI, data, and decision-making systems, where I design solutions that are not just intelligent, but production-ready and reliable.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">
          I bring 8.7+ years of experience across finance, insurance, e-commerce, and analytics-driven consulting, where I have worked on translating ambiguous business problems into structured, data-driven solutions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">
          My transition into AI engineering is rooted in a strong business foundation, allowing me to approach AI systems with a practical mindset — focusing on real-world impact, scalability, and integration into enterprise workflows rather than just model performance.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">What I Work On</h2>

        <ul className="text-gray-400 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>• Agentic AI systems and autonomous workflows</li>
          <li>• LLM-powered applications (Text-to-SQL, RAG systems)</li>
          <li>• End-to-end AI system design (data → model → deployment)</li>
          <li>• Production-grade GenAI systems with reliability and safety controls</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Technical Focus</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">
          I work extensively with Python, SQL, LangChain, LangGraph, and modern LLM tooling. My experience includes building systems with prompt engineering, orchestration pipelines, validation layers, and integrating AI into scalable backend systems. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Professional Experience</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
          Currently working as a Lead AI/ML Engineer, I focus on building production-grade AI systems and leading AI-driven initiatives.
        </p>

        <ul className="text-gray-400 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>• Led analytics initiatives identifying $8M–$12M in business impact</li>
          <li>• Delivered 100+ data-driven reports used in financial decision-making</li>
          <li>• Led cross-functional teams of up to 15 members</li>
          <li>• Improved operational efficiency by up to 45% through data systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">What Makes Me Different</h2>

        <p className="text-gray-400 mb-6">
          My core strength lies in combining business understanding with technical execution. I don’t just build models — I build systems that integrate into real workflows, handle edge cases, manage trade-offs like cost and latency, and deliver measurable outcomes.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-400">
          I am particularly interested in building agentic AI systems that can reason, act, and operate autonomously within structured environments.
